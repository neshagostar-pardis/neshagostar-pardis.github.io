# Double-Walled Polyethylene Pipes Installation Guide

## Required Tools and Equipment

### Main Tools
- Excavator (for trench digging)
- Spirit level (for slope adjustment)
- Measuring tape
- Rubber mallet
- Electric or manual saw (for pipe cutting)

### Auxiliary Materials
- Coarse sand and gravel (for pipe bedding)
- Suitable soil for backfilling
- Connection couplings
- Gaskets, bolts, and nuts

## Installation Steps

### 1. Preparation and Design

**Drawing Review:**
- Mark pipe locations according to drawings
- Calculate appropriate slope (minimum 0.5%)
- Identify interference points with other utilities

**Site Survey:**
- Examine soil conditions
- Ensure no underground obstacles exist
- Check machinery access

### 2. Trench Excavation

**Trench Dimensions:**
- Depth: Minimum 80cm (based on pipe diameter and application)
- Width: 1.5 times pipe external diameter + 30cm
- Bottom slope: 0.5 to 2 percent

**Important Points:**
- Trench bottom must be completely level and uniform
- Prevent rocks and sharp objects in trench bottom
- In non-homogeneous soils, use suitable materials for leveling

### 3. Bedding Preparation

**First Layer (Under Pipe):**
- Thickness: 10cm coarse sand and gravel
- Compaction: Well compacted
- Leveling: Surface must be completely smooth

**Second Layer (Beside Pipe):**
- Materials: Sand and gravel or suitable soil without rocks
- Compaction: Hand or appropriate tool compaction

### 4. Pipe Laying and Connection

**Transportation:**
- Avoid improper handling that causes scratches or impact
- Store pipes in suitable locations

**Laying:**
- Place pipe gently without creating stress in the trench
- Prevent excessive bending (less than minimum allowable bending radius)
- Follow pipe direction according to specifications

**Connections:**
- Use standard and appropriate couplings
- Clean pipe ends before connection
- Place rubber gaskets in position
- Tighten connections firmly but without excessive pressure

### 5. Testing and Quality Control

**Level Testing:**
- Check pipe slope with spirit level
- Make necessary corrections if required

**Leak Testing:**
- Fill pipe with water
- Apply pressure for 24 hours
- Check connection points for leaks

### 6. Trench Backfilling

**First Layer:**
- Up to 30cm above pipe height
- Materials: Sand and gravel or suitable soil
- Compaction: By hand with care

**Upper Layers:**
- Materials: Suitable soil according to project specifications
- Compaction: With appropriate mechanical tools
- Layer height: Maximum 30cm each

## Safety Guidelines

### Before Starting Work
⚠️ **Mandatory**: Use safety helmet, safety shoes, and gloves
⚠️ **Important**: Check trench wall conditions before worker entry
⚠️ **Essential**: Proper ladder for trench exit

### During Work
- Prevent unauthorized persons from approaching work area
- Cover trench if necessary
- Stop work in rainy conditions

## Important Notes and Recommendations

✅ **Initial Inspection**: Before installation, check all pipes for integrity

✅ **Storage**: Store pipes in dry place away from direct sunlight

✅ **Temperature**: Perform installation at appropriate temperature (5 to 35°C)

✅ **Consultation**: In case of doubt, consult with company technical experts

## Common Troubleshooting

| Problem | Probable Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Connection leak | Defective gasket | Replace gasket |
| Unauthorized pipe bend | Improper installation | Correct route |
| Pipe crack | Mechanical impact | Replace damaged section |
